Rather than relying on computationally expensive multi-task retraining, we leverage Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning **(PEFT)** and Model Merging techniques **(TIES/DARE)**. The goal is to create a model that excels at identifying correct legal holdings (via the CaseHOLD dataset) while maintaining robust, generalist legal reasoning across diverse tasks (via LegalBench). By merging two specialized LoRA experts, we would like to achieve a high-performance legal assistant that minimizes catastrophic forgetting and remains efficient for deployment."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"171ea25d","metadata":{"id":"171ea25d"},"source":["### Project Roadmap\n","The notebook is structured into the following five key phases:\n","\n","1.  **Environment Setup & Model Initialization**: Configuring the\n","environment with Unsloth for optimized 4-bit loading of the Llama 3.1 8B base model.\n","\n","2. **Expert 1 Fine-Tuning (CaseHOLD)**: Training a LoRA adapter specialized in case-law precedent identification and holding selection.\n","\n","3. **Expert 2 Fine-Tuning (LegalBench)**: Training a second LoRA adapter on a curated selection of 15+ tasks to capture broad legal logic and rule application.\n","\n","4. **Model Merging (TIES/DARE)**: Merging the two adapters into a single set of weights using Mergekit, resolving parameter interference via sparsification and rescaling.\n","\n","5. **Evaluation of Resulting Models**: Quantitatively comparing the merged model against the base model and individual experts to assess knowledge retention and synergy."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ce91c7e7","metadata":{"id":"ce91c7e7"},"source":["## Environment Setup & Model Initialization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f79cc638","metadata":{"id":"f79cc638"},"source":["Since legal text analysis and model fine-tuning are computationally intensive, we utilize **Unsloth**, a lightweight wrapper for the Hugging Face ecosystem that significantly accelerates training and reduces VRAM consumption.\n","\n"," **Unsloth** provides up to 2x faster finetuning and consumes 30% less VRAM, allowing for the use of larger batch sizes without crashing the GPU. It achieves this efficiency by applying optimized \"patches\" to the model's layers and leveraging 4-bit quantization through bitsandbytes, which enables large-scale models to fit within standard memory constraints, such as those of an NVIDIA T4. By integrating memory-efficient attention mechanisms like xformers, Unsloth ensures a highly efficient workflow for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) while maintaining the original model's accuracy\n","\n","We install `unsloth` alongside essential libraries for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).

models using LoRA. This relatively low value ensures that the model undergoes stable weight updates **without risking catastrophic forgetting**, which occurs when a model loses its pre-trained general knowledge by making overly aggressive adjustments. In a specialized field like law, maintaining the underlying linguistic logic while carefully adapting to specific legal terminology is crucial.\n","\n","- **Learning Dynamics:** To further enhance stability, a **Cosine Learning Rate Scheduler** with a 10% warmup ratio is employed. This allows the model to start with a very low rate that gradually increases, preventing early training divergence, before smoothly decaying. This helps the model converge more effectively toward a global minimum during the single training epoch.\n","\n","- **Memory Efficiency:** By setting the `per_device_train_batch_size` to 1 and `gradient_accumulation_steps` to 16, we achieve an effective batch size of 16. This allows for stable gradient updates while keeping the VRAM footprint low. The use of the adamw_8bit optimizer further reduces memory consumption by quantizing the optimizer states without significantly sacrificing precision.\n","\n","- **Evaluation and Early Stopping:** To **prevent overfitting** on the legal corpus, an EarlyStoppingCallback is utilized with a patience of 2 evaluation cycles. Setting eval_strategy=\"steps\" at **every 250 steps**, combined with load_best_model_at_end=True, ensures that the final model is the one that demonstrated the best generalization performance on the validation set."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"68169845","metadata":{"id":"68169845"},"outputs":[],"source":["log_file_path_ch = BASE_PATH + \"training_logs_caseHOLD.jsonl\"\n","checkpoint_path = BASE_PATH + \"checkpoints_caseHOLD\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bdad2c69","metadata":{"id":"bdad2c69"},"outputs":[],"source":["if RUN_TRAINING_caseHold:\n","\n","  # Initialize Weights & Biases for logging\n","  run_name = \"expert-1-casehold-lora\"\n","  wandb.init(project=\"Legal-Model-Merging\", name=run_name, mode=\"disabled\")\n","\n","  trainer = SFTTrainer(\n","      model=model,\n","      tokenizer=tokenizer,\n","      train_dataset=train_dataset_ch,\n","      eval_dataset=eval_dataset_ch,\n","      dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n","      max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n","      data_collator=DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer=tokenizer),\n","      dataset_num_proc = 2,\n","      callbacks=[\n","        EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience=2),\n","        DriveLogCallback(log_file_path_ch)\n","      ],\n","\n","      args=TrainingArguments(\n","          per_device_train_batch_size = 1,\n","          gradient_accumulation_steps = 16,\n","\n","          dataloader_num_workers = 2,     # Load data in parallel\n","          dataloader_pin_memory = True,   # Direct passage RAM -> VRAM\n","\n","          warmup_ratio=0.1,\n","          num_train_epochs=1,\n","          learning_rate=2e-5,\n","\n","          eval_strategy=\"steps\",\n","          eval_steps=250,\n","          save_steps=250,\n","\n","          fp16=not torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported(),\n","          bf16=torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported(),\n","          optim=\"adamw_8bit\",\n","          lr_scheduler_type=\"cosine\",\n","          output_dir=checkpoint_path,\n","          report_to=\"none\",\n","          save_total_limit=1,\n","          load_best_model_at_end=True,\n","          logging_steps=10,\n","      ),\n","  )"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"54a2893f","metadata":{"id":"54a2893f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"a51763e4-bd47-40e9-c4f1-9e836705968b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Step       | Training Loss   | Validation Loss\n","---------------------------------------------\n","250        | 1.632200        | 1.650124       \n","500        | 1.650800        | 1.634871       \n"]}],"source":["if RUN_TRAINING_caseHold:\n","  # Start Training\n","  print(\"Starting training...\")\n","  trainer_stats = trainer.train()\n","else:\n","  print_training_logs(log_file_path_ch)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a35a0e0c","metadata":{"id":"a35a0e0c"},"source":["### Saving the Expert Adapter"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3693d31c","metadata":{"id":"3693d31c"},"source":["Upon completion, we export only the **LoRA adapters**.

This prevents training failures downstream caused by `None` types or empty strings, which are not uncommon in large-scale legal corpora."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"cc819640","metadata":{"id":"cc819640","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":145,"referenced_widgets":["7854b77371c0418ead9d31d6ea16e9ce","395f3b54dd6f48e38864238f1757dbae","a50526b658724cf3ba56417a259701bc","37c4bb176ead4daa87fad2f1a841d131","90739d528ba3485fb331fe14113800b7","af912111a46a47d3bfb23d7efb042b06","81f4e29900e242d0a9ecfe8037496da9","de1c23ad9fdf4e69b22e2f6e32344c50","b37a8060a84a498bbd501f6b358be93c","c4c63cdacf4a4955b22ab7d2c857ccf1","b17c51c74e4c45f3b8bef0c24246b572","8af177ec72a54dd8b61c252d44dc1150","9f17881774df4e258d061d2e22b20344","bddfc8461bbd43aab264daa9bd6d47b2","24da8a3ee33348aeb7e31baff9f59517","694dd3a41eec4d2590a59b6cc6f10293","bbea745c922f40b8998dcf54d41f3442","9fc245286d424d1ea5fa50ca0a81cbed","77eba2370b5c4432a739a4698315fc2a","8eece7fb1a7c45029feb6e2f3efaee9e","810bb3e650844ff1acbf766eee10da46","a1810d885f734ad09f4ced3da630837f","e7603506f9294699b09410bd88d54dc3","25465bac10c24112a2a768ecac0bef30","bf67c48a2d434c34930a6be41fa3b99b","b8e8e3aba8d64611a2b463c69fc0aaa4","995f54a789744d95a60eea79a3a099b1","62f172b5b14e4555aeab176d189507a9","fcd63f74f123413ea7ad986e632d22c7","059c957ccb4447da90f4fcc57241273e","91211c0b4faf4aeeae80f02c92254a8d","0312d1a4f1504acebe8fd655247ea92d","c106711ed5c5474ab0c76250a8f8133f","75e474e65acc4f08a277ad51d4bc57f5","ddb9624993e64ec3bb8f5a05774359c7","da833a0d94ab4d81bc982890816c9871","8d16521f5095434aa28043754303e515","7a38931afdd543c5b0b2a7a0bb3a622f","a698f2475c904a4b81b953581807f82e","5bc06b1c1664459da4f061aa1d7f5e00","aa08a343023044a0a90be3a3e931a1f0","ae72cf102ec846a3b5548c206f9e74b8","0fe02108bb9249598746e61f5b11b32d","53e6fc1e1eb9421d95214e87c462af48"]},"outputId":"c0d0691d-47ae-4bef-e300-f84488c97eb9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769454145697,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4016,"user":{"displayName":"MARTINA FABIANI","userId":"14006841485553139934"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/425 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"7854b77371c0418ead9d31d6ea16e9ce"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet:   0%|          | 0.00/34.5M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"8af177ec72a54dd8b61c252d44dc1150"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/90394 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e7603506f9294699b09410bd88d54dc3"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Filter:   0%|          | 0/90394 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"75e474e65acc4f08a277ad51d4bc57f5"}},"metadata":{}}],"source":["# LOAD LegalBench\n","\n","dataset_lb = load_dataset(\"Equall/legalbench_instruct\", split=\"train\")\n","\n","dataset_lb = dataset_lb.filter(\n","    lambda x: isinstance(x.get(\"inputs\"), str) and isinstance(x.get(\"answer\"), str)\n","              and len(x[\"inputs\"].strip()) > 0 and len(x[\"answer\"].strip()) > 0\n",")\n","\n","dataset_lb = dataset_lb.shuffle(seed=42)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ccc5f284","metadata":{"id":"ccc5f284"},"outputs":[],"source":["def balanced_disjoint_splits_by_task(\n","    dataset: Dataset,\n","    task_col: str = \"task_type\",\n","    train_size: int = 8000,\n","    val_size: int = 500,\n","    test_size: int = 1000,\n","    seed: int = 42,\n","):\n","    #
